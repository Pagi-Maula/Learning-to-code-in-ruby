# Description 
# Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

#For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

# solution :

def square_sum(numbers)
  size = numbers.size #extracting the size of the given array
  limit = 0 
  sum = 0
  until limit == size do # settting up a loop for the method to square a number
    multiplier = numbers[limit] # setting the variable to a five element of the array
    multiplier = multiplier ** 2 # squaring the element of the array
    sum = sum + multiplier # making the sum
    limit = limit + 1 
    end
  return sum # returns the sum of the squared values
  
end
