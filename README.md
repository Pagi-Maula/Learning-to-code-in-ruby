## About Ruby

Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan.

**Ruby is "A Programmer's Best Friend".**

Ruby has features that are similar to those of Smalltalk, Perl, and Python. Perl, Python, and Smalltalk are scripting languages. Smalltalk is a true object-oriented language. Ruby, like Smalltalk, is a perfect object-oriented language. Using Ruby syntax is much easier than using Smalltalk syntax.
